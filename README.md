### 3rd Year Software Engineering Group Project Report
Please could everyone write in their assigned sections to avoid merge errors. Thank you.

Sections and subsection (even subsubsections) can be added as necessary when writing the report. Please do so if necessary to avoid cluttering.

The specifications for the report structure can be found on the [wiki](https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk/display/docteaching/Group+Project+Report+Structure)

A brief is provided here

1. Executive Summary
  * Your 'elevator pitch'

2. Introduction
  * Set the scene ('motivation')
  * State the problem you are trying to solve ('objective(s)')
  * Summarise your main achievements

3. Design and Implementation
  * Detail your design (why did you do it this way?) - design of your software, possibly including a diagram of the major components
  * Summarise key implementation details (how did you do it? What technology was used and why? What other technology was considered, but not used and why?)
  * Any technical challenges encountered and how they were addressed?
  * Any risks anticipated, and how they were mitigated

4. Evaluation
  * Assess your software quality (did you do any unit testing, what about performance testing for scalability)
  * Summarise user evaluation (how did your final users find your product?)

5. Ethical Considerations
  * Reflect on the product that you built and any key ethical issues associated with it - what did you learn? What might you have done differently?

6. Bibliography
